Experimental Features
*********************

This section includes a set of experimental features that our team wants feedback on before adding them into core |productName|. 
Experimental features are *not* ready for production. These features are under active development and intended to make their way into core |productName|, but there are several key considerations to make when building on top of these:

1. *Backward compatibility is not guaranteed* - Our goal is to maintain backward compatibility whenever possible, but user feedback (and our own internal research)
   may result in necessary changes to the APIs.

**Workflow Interface**

    Learn how to:
        - Chain a series of tasks that run on aggregator or collaborator.
        - Filter out information that should stay local
        - Use Metaflow tools to analyze and debug experiments

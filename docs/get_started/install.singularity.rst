.. note::

   Make sure you've run the :ref:`the initial steps <install_package>` section first.

    be building the Singularity containers. To check
    that Docker is installed and running properly, you
    can run the Docker *Hello World* command like this:

    .. code-block:: console

      $ docker run hello-world
      Hello from Docker!
      This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

    You'll need Singularity installed on all nodes. 
    To check that Singularity is installed, run the following:

    .. code-block:: console

      $ singularity help

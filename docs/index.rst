*******************************************
Welcome to the |productName| documentation!
*******************************************

Intel\ :sup:`Â®` \ Federated Learning (|productName|) is a Python3 library for federated learning.
It enables organizations to collaborately train a
model without sharing sensitive information with each other.

There are basically two components in the library:
the *collaborator* which uses local dataset to train
a global model and the *aggregator* which receives
model updates from collaborators and combines them to form 
the global model.

The *aggregator* is framework-agnostic, while the *collaborator*
can use any deep learning frameworks, such as `Tensorflow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_ or
`PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_.

|productName| is developed by Intel Labs and Intel Internet of Things Group.

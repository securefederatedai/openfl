Override Aggregation Function
*****************************

With the aggregator-based workflow, you can use custom aggregation functions for each task via Python\*\  API or command line interface.


Python API
==========

1. Create an implementation of :class:`openfl.interface.aggregation_functions.core.AggregationFunction`.

2. In the ``override_config`` keyword argument of the :func:`openfl.native.run_experiment` native function, pass the implementation as a ``tasks.{task_name}.aggregation_type`` parameter.

.. note::
    See `Federated PyTorch MNIST Tutorial <https://github.com/intel/openfl/blob/develop/openfl-tutorials/Federated_Pytorch_MNIST_custom_aggregation_Tutorial.ipynb>`_ for an example of the custom aggregation function.
    

Command Line Interface
======================

Predefined Aggregation Functions
--------------------------------

Choose from the following predefined aggregation functions:

- ``openfl.interface.aggregation_functions.WeightedAverage`` (default)
- ``openfl.interface.aggregation_functions.Median``
- ``openfl.interface.aggregation_functions.GeometricMedian``
- ``openfl.interface.aggregation_functions.AdagradAdaptiveAggregation``
- ``openfl.interface.aggregation_functions.AdamAdaptiveAggregation``
- ``openfl.interface.aggregation_functions.YogiAdaptiveAggregation``

Adaptive Aggregation Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
    To create adaptive aggregation functions,
    the user must specify parameters for the aggregation optimizer
    (``NumPyAdagrad``, ``NumPyAdam`` or ``NumPyYogi``) that will aggregate
    the global model. Theese parameters parameters are passed via **keywords**.

    Also, user must pass one of the arguments: ``params``
    - model parameters (a dictionary with named model parameters
    in the form of numpy arrays), or pass ``model_interface``
    - an instance of the `ModelInterface <https://github.com/intel/openfl/blob/develop/openfl/interface/interactive_api/experiment.py>`_ class.
    If user pass both ``params`` and ``model_interface``,
    then the optimizer parameters are initialized via
    ``params``, ignoring ``model_interface`` argument.

    See the `AdagradAdaptiveAggregation
    <https://github.com/intel/openfl/blob/develop/openfl/interface/aggregation_functions/adagrad_adaptive_aggregation.py>`_
    definitions for details.

    `Adaptive federated optimization <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00295.pdf>`_ original paper.

``AdagradAdaptiveAggregation`` usage example:

.. code-block:: python

    from openfl.interface.interactive_api.experiment import TaskInterface, ModelInterface
    from openfl.interface.aggregation_functions import AdagradAdaptiveAggregation

    TI = TaskInterface()
    MI = ModelInterface(model=model,
                        optimizer=optimizer,
                        framework_plugin=framework_adapter)
    ...

    # Creating aggregation function
    agg_fn = AdagradAdaptiveAggregation(model_interface=MI,
                                        learning_rate=0.4)

    # Define training task
    @TI.register_fl_task(model='model', data_loader='train_loader', \
                            device='device', optimizer='optimizer')
    @TI.set_aggregation_function(agg_fn)
    def train(...):
    ...

You can define your own numpy based optimizer,
which will be used for global model aggreagation:

.. code-block:: python

    from openfl.utilities.optimizers.numpy.base_optimizer import Optimizer

    class MyOpt(Optimizer):
        """My optimizer implementation."""

        def __init__(
            self,
            *,
            params: Optional[Dict[str, np.ndarray]] = None,
            model_interface=None,
            learning_rate: float = 0.001,
            param1: Any = None,
            param2: Any = None
        ) -> None:
            """Initialize.

            Args:
                params: Parameters to be stored for optimization.
                model_interface: Model interface instance to provide parameters.
                learning_rate: Tuning parameter that determines
                    the step size at each iteration.
                param1: My own defined parameter.
                param2: My own defined parameter.
            """
            super().__init__()
            pass # Your code here!

        def step(self, gradients: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> None:
            """
            Perform a single step for parameter update.

            Implement your own optimizer weights update rule.

            Args:
                gradients: Partial derivatives with respect to optimized parameters.
            """
            pass # Your code here!
    ...

    from openfl.interface.aggregation_functions import WeightedAverage
    from openfl.interface.aggregation_functions.core import AdaptiveAggregation

    # Creating your implemented optimizer instance based on numpy:
    my_own_optimizer = MyOpt(model_interface=MI, learning_rate=0.01)

    # Creating aggregation function
    agg_fn = AdaptiveAggregation(optimizer=my_own_optimizer,
                                 agg_func=WeightedAverage()) # WeightedAverage() is used for aggregating
                                                             # parameters that are not inside the given optimizer.

    # Define training task
    @TI.register_fl_task(model='model', data_loader='train_loader', \
                            device='device', optimizer='optimizer')
    @TI.set_aggregation_function(agg_fn)
    def train(...):
    ...

.. note::
    If you do not understand how to write your own numpy based optimizer, please see the `NumPyAdagrad <https://github.com/intel/openfl/blob/develop/openfl/utilities/optimizers/numpy/adagrad_optimizer.py>`_ and
    `AdaptiveAggregation <https://github.com/intel/openfl/blob/develop/openfl/interface/aggregation_functions/core/adaptive_aggregation.py>`_ definitions for details.

Custom Aggregation Functions
----------------------------

OpenFL provides interfaces to support your own custom aggregation functions. You can also create your own implementation of :class:`openfl.interface.aggregation_functions.core.AggregationFunction`. See `example <https://github.com/intel/openfl/blob/develop/openfl-tutorials/Federated_Pytorch_MNIST_custom_aggregation_Tutorial.ipynb>`_ for details.

1. Define the behavior of the aggregation.

2. Include the implementation in the **plan.yaml** file in the **plan** directory of your workspace.

3. In the **tasks** section,  pick a task for which you want to change the aggregation and insert ``aggregation_type`` section with a single ``template`` key that defines a module path to your class.

The following is an example of a **plan.yaml** with a modified aggregation function:
  
.. code-block:: yaml

  # ...
  # other top-level sections
  # ...
  tasks:
    aggregated_model_validation:
      function: validate
      kwargs:
        apply: global
        metrics:
        - acc
    defaults: plan/defaults/tasks_torch.yaml
    locally_tuned_model_validation:
      function: validate
      kwargs:
      apply: local
      metrics:
      - acc
    settings: {}
    train:
      function: train_batches
      aggregation_type:
        template: openfl.interface.aggregation_functions.Median  
      kwargs:
        metrics:
        - loss


Interactive API
================
You can override aggregation function that will be used for the task this function corresponds to.
In order to do this, call the ``set_aggregation_function`` decorator method of ``TaskInterface`` and pass ``AggregationFunction`` subclass instance as a parameter.
For example, you can try:

.. code-block:: python

    from openfl.interface.aggregation_functions import Median
    TI = TaskInterface()
    agg_fn = Median()
    @TI.register_fl_task(model='model', data_loader='train_loader', \
                         device='device', optimizer='optimizer')
    @TI.set_aggregation_function(agg_fn)

.. warning::
    All tasks with the same type of aggregation use the same class instance.
    If ``AggregationFunction`` implementation has its own state, then this state will be shared across tasks.


``AggregationFunction`` requires a single ``call`` function.
This function receives tensors for a single parameter from multiple collaborators with additional metadata (see definition of :meth:`openfl.interface.aggregation_functions.core.AggregationFunction.call`) and returns a single tensor that represents the result of aggregation.


.. note::
    See the `definition <https://github.com/intel/openfl/blob/develop/openfl/interface/aggregation_functions/core/interface.py>`_ of :class:`openfl.interface.aggregation_functions.core.AggregationFunction.call` for details.


Example of a Custom Aggregation Function
========================================

This is an example of a custom tensor clipping aggregation function that multiplies all local tensors by 0.3 and averages them according to weights equal to data parts to produce the resulting global tensor.

.. code-block:: python

    from openfl.interface.aggregation_functions import AggregationFunction
    import numpy as np

    class ClippedAveraging(AggregationFunction):
        def __init__(self, ratio):
            self.ratio = ratio
            
        def call(self,
                local_tensors,
                db_iterator,
                tensor_name,
                fl_round,

                            These tensors are passed to the aggregator node after local learning.
                        - 'aggregated' indicates that tensor is a result of aggregation.

                            for a specific tensor.

Example of a Privileged Aggregation Function
========================================

Most of the time the AggregationFunction interface is sufficient to implement custom methods, but in certain scenarios users may want to store additional information inside the TensorDB Dataframe beyond the aggregated tensor. The :class:`openfl.interface.aggregation_functions.experimental.PrivilegedAggregationFunction` interface is provided for this use, and gives the user direct access to aggregator's TensorDB dataframe (notice the `tensor_db` param in the call function replaces the `db_iterator` from the standard AggregationFunction interface). As the name suggests, this interface is called privileged because with great power comes great responsibility, and modifying the TensorDB dataframe directly can lead to unexpected behavior and experiment failures if entries are arbitrarily deleted.

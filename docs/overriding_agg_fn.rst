===============================
Overriding aggregation function
===============================

-------------------------------
Usage
-------------------------------
|productName| allows developers to use custom aggregation functions per task.
In order to do this, you should:

Python API
==========

Create an implementation of :class:`openfl.component.aggregation_functions.AggregationFunctionInterface`
and pass it as ``tasks.{task_name}.aggregation_type`` parameter of ``override_config`` keyword argument of :func:`openfl.native.run_experiment` native function.

CLI
====

Choose from predefined |productName| aggregation functions:

- ``openfl.component.aggregation_functions.WeightedAverage`` (default)
- ``openfl.component.aggregation_functions.Median``
- ``openfl.component.aggregation_functions.GeometricMedian``
Or create your own implementation of :class:`openfl.component.aggregation_functions.AggregationFunctionInterface`.
After defining the aggregation behavior, you need to include it in ``plan/plan.yaml`` file of your workspace.
Inside ``tasks`` section pick a task for which you want to change the aggregation
and insert ``aggregation_type`` section with a single ``template`` key that defines a module path to your class.

Example of ``plan/plan.yaml`` with modified aggregation function:
  
.. code-block:: yaml

  # ...
  # other top-level sections
  # ...
  tasks:
    aggregated_model_validation:
      function: validate
      kwargs:
        apply: global
        metrics:
        - acc
    defaults: plan/defaults/tasks_torch.yaml
    locally_tuned_model_validation:
      function: validate
      kwargs:
      apply: local
      metrics:
      - acc
    settings: {}
    train:
      function: train_batches
      aggregation_type:
        template: openfl.component.aggregation_functions.Median  
      kwargs:
        metrics:
        - loss

``AggregationFunctionInterface`` requires a single ``call`` function.
This function receives tensors for a single parameter from multiple collaborators with additional metadata (see definition of :meth:`openfl.component.aggregation_functions.AggregationFunctionInterface.call`) and returns a single tensor that represents the result of aggregation.

.. note::
    By default, we use weighted averaging with weights equal to data parts (FedAvg).

Example
=======================

Below is an example of a custom tensor clipping aggregation function that multiplies all local tensors by 0.3 and averages them according to weights equal to data parts to produce the resulting global tensor.

.. code-block:: python

    from openfl.component.aggregation_functions import AggregationFunctionInterface
    import numpy as np

    class ClippedAveraging(AggregationFunctionInterface):
        def __init__(self, ratio):
            self.ratio = ratio
            
        def call(self,
                local_tensors,
                db_iterator,
                tensor_name,
                fl_round,
                *__):
            """Aggregate tensors.

            Args:
                local_tensors(list[openfl.utilities.LocalTensor]): List of local tensors to aggregate.
                db_iterator: iterator over history of all tensors. Columns:
                    - 'tensor_name': name of the tensor.
                        Examples for `torch.nn.Module`s: 'conv1.weight', 'fc2.bias'.
                    - 'round': 0-based number of round corresponding to this tensor.
                    - 'tags': tuple of tensor tags. Tags that can appear:
                        - 'model' indicates that the tensor is a model parameter.
                        - 'trained' indicates that tensor is a part of a training result.
                            These tensors are passed to the aggregator node after local learning.
                        - 'aggregated' indicates that tensor is a result of aggregation.
                            These tensors are sent to collaborators for the next round.
                        - 'delta' indicates that value is a difference between rounds
                            for a specific tensor.
                        also one of the tags is a collaborator name
                        if it corresponds to a result of a local task.

                    - 'nparray': value of the tensor.
                tensor_name: name of the tensor
                fl_round: round number
                tags: tuple of tags for this tensor
            Returns:
                np.ndarray: aggregated tensor

            clipped_tensors = []

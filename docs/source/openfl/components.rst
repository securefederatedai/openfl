Spawning components
###################

Aggregator
===========

The *Aggregator* is a short-living entity, which means that its lifespan is limited by experiment execution time. 
It orchestrates *Collaborators* according to the FL plan and performs model aggregation at the end of each round.
The *Aggregator* is spawned by the *Director* (described below) when a new experiment is submitted.


Collaborator
=============

*Collaborator* is also a short living entity, it manages training the model on local data: executes assigned tasks, 
converts DL framework-specific tensor objects to |productName| inner representation, and exchanges model parameters with the aggregator.
Converting tensors is done by :ref:`Framework adapter <framework_adapter>` plugins. |productName| ships with Pytorch and Tensorflow 2.x framework adapters. 
These framework adapters are intended to be extensible, 
and we encourage users to contribute new adapters for DL frameworks they would like to see supported in |productName|. 

Model is loaded with relevant weights before every task and at the end of the training task, weights are extracted to be sent to the central node and aggregated.
*Collaborator* instance is created by *Envoy* (described below) when a new experiment is submitted. 
Every *Collaborator* is a unique service as it is loaded with a local *Shard Descriptor* to perform tasks included in an FL experiment.

Long-living components
######################

Director
==========

*Director* is a long-living entity; it is a central node of the federation and may take in several experiments 
(with the same data interface). When an experiment is reported director starts an aggregator and sends 
the experiment data to involved envoys; during the experiment, Director oversees the aggregator and updates 
the user on the status of the experiment.
*Director* runs two services: one for frontend users and another one for envoys. It can distribute an experiment 
reported with the frontend API across the federation and communicate back a trained model snapshot and metrics.
*Director* supports several concurrent frontend connections (yet experiments are run one by one).
To learn more about using the |productName| frontend Python API, please refer to :ref:`interactive_api`


Envoy
=========

|productName| comes with another long-existing actor called *Envoy*. It runs on collaborator machines connected to a *Director*. 
There is one to one mapping between *Envoys* and Dataset shards: every *Envoy* needs exactly one 
`Shard Descriptor <https://github.com/intel/openfl/blob/develop/openfl/interface/interactive_api/shard_descriptor.py>`_ to run. 
When the *Director* starts an experiment, *Envoy* will accept the experiment workspace, prepare the environment and start a *Collaborator*.

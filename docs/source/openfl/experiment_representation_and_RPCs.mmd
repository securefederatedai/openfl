  note over ER,D: Experiment registry is a queue-like object
  D->>-F: Approves

  F->>+D: Get Registered experiments
  D->>ER: Gets name and status
  note over ER,D: Registry can also return <br>an experiment list by user id
  D->>-F: Approves

    note over ER,D: Assuming the Experiment is the next in the queue <br>and the Envoy is assigned for this Experiment
    D->>ER: Gets experiment name (pop operation)
    D->>-E: Wait Experiment Response

    E->>+D: Get Experiment Data
    D->>ER: Gets experiment archive (by name)
    D->>ER: Sets status to In Progress

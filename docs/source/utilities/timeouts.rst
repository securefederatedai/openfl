.. _comp_timeout_overview:

Overview
========

This feature allows decorating any arbitrary synchronous and/or asynchronous functions using :code:`@fedtiming(timeout=<seconds>)`. 
The decorated functions is then monitored and gets terminated right after the execution time exceeds the user specified or default timeout value.

`openfl.utilities.fed_timer.py`

.. note::
     
    The `fedtiming` class, `SyncAsyncTaskDecoFactory` factory class, custom synchronous and asynchronous execution of decorated function is in-place. The end to end implementation of |productName| Component timeouts feature is still in beta mode and would undergo design and implementation changes before the complete feature is made available. Appreciate any feedbacks or issues.

.. _comp_timeout_flow_of_execution:

Flow of execution
===================

#. [Step A] Decorate any sync or async function :code:`@fedtiming(timeout=<seconds>)` to monitor its execution time and terminate after `timeout=<seconds>` value.


      .. code-block:: console

        @fedtiming(timeout=5)
        def some_sync_function():
            pass

      | This decorated function execution gets terminated after `5 seconds`.

      .. code-block:: console

        @fedtiming(timeout=10)
        async def some_async_function():
            await some_long_running_operation()

      | This decorated function execution gets terminated after `10 seconds`.

#. [Step B] Concrete `fedtiming` class:

    **During Compile time:** Decorated functions are evaluated like below.
       
      **Synchronous Example:**

      .. code-block:: console

        some_sync_function = fedtiming(timeout=5)(some_sync_function)

        then 

        some_sync_function() *is equivalent to* sync_wrapper().

      inside the sync_wrapper: the decorated function `some_sync_function` and `timeout` variables are stored as a closure variable.
        
      **Aynchronous Example:**

      .. code-block:: console

        some_async_function = fedtiming(timeout=5)(some_async_function)

        then 

        some_async_function() *is equivalent to* async_wrapper().

      inside the async_wrapper: the decorated function `some_async_function` and `timeout` variables are stored as a closure variable.
        
    
#. [Step C] `SyncAsyncTaskDecoFactory` class 

    `fedtiming(some_sync_function)` internally calls the parent class `SyncAsyncTaskDecoFactory` :code:`__call__(some_sync_function)` method.
    
    The :code:`__call__()` method immediately returns either the `sync_wrapper` or `async_wrapper` depending on whether the sync or async method was decorated.
      

    **During Runtime:**
       
     The prepared `some_sync_function` or `some_async_function` when called internally with its respective parameters.

     .. code-block:: console

      some_sync_function(*args, **kwargs) -> sync_wrapper(*args, **kwargs)
      some_async_function(*args, **kwargs) -> async_wrapper(*args, **kwargs)


#. [Step D] `PrepareTask` class
    
    Delegates the decorated sync or async function to be executed synchronously or asynchronously using `CustomThread` or `asyncio`.
    
    Contains the defination for the function `sync_execute` and `async_execute`.

#. [Step E] Execution of delegated methods:

    The delegated function is executed synchronously or asynchronously and the result is returned back in the call chain.
    The final output from the `thread` or `asyncio` task is returned as a result of a decorated function execution.

    In this `CustomThread` or `asyncio.wait_for()` execution, the timeout is enforced which terminates the running function after a set period of time and an exception is called that tracebacks to the caller.

.. _comp_timeout_upcoming_feature:

Upcoming Changes
===================

**Above design reflects current implementation.**

Upcoming changes include:

 1. Dynamic timeout parameters updates for all decorated functions during runtime. Removal of `timeout` parameter `@fedtiming(timeout=<?>)`.

 2. Add a callback parameter that defines a post timeout teardown logic and a way gracefully terminate executing function.

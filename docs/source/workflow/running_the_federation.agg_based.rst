First make sure you've installed the software :ref:`using these instructions <install_initial_steps>`

The high-level workflow is shown in the figure above. Note that once OpenFL is installed on all nodes of the federation and every member of the federation has a valid PKI certificate, all that is needed to run an instance of a federated workload is to distribute the workspace to all federation members and then run the command to start the node (e.g. :code:`fx aggregator start`/:code:`fx collaborator start`). In other words, most of the work is setting up an initial environment on all of the federation nodes that can be used across new instantiations of federations.

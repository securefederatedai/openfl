    "Now we come to the flow definition. The OpenFL Workflow Interface adopts the conventions set by Metaflow, that every workflow begins with `start` and concludes with the `end` task. The aggregator begins with a base model and optimizer. The aggregator begins the flow with the `start` task, where the list of collaborators is extracted from the runtime (`self.collaborators = self.runtime.collaborators`) and is then used as the list of participants to run the task listed in `self.next`, `aggregated_model_validation`. The model, optimizer, and anything that is not explicitly excluded from the next function will be passed from the `start` function on the aggregator to the `aggregated_model_validation` task on the collaborator. Where the tasks run is determined by the placement decorator that precedes each task definition (`@aggregator` or `@collaborator`). Once each of the collaborators (defined in the runtime) complete the `aggregated_model_validation` task, they pass their current state onto the `train` task, from `train` to `local_model_validation`, and then finally to `join` at the aggregator. It is in `join` that an average is taken of the model weights, and the next round can begin. Throughout the process, we will save out the collaborator models as well as the final aggregated model.\n",

# MedMNIST 2D Classification Using FedProx Optimizer Tutorial

![MedMNISTv2_overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MedMNIST/MedMNIST/main/assets/medmnistv2.jpg)

For more details, please refer to the original paper:
**MedMNIST v2: A Large-Scale Lightweight Benchmark for 2D and 3D Biomedical Image Classification** ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14795)), and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/medmnist/).

This example differs from PyTorch_MedMNIST_2D in that it uses the FedProx Optimizer. For more information on FedProx see:
**Federated Optimization in Heterogeneous Networks** ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06127)).

## I. About model and experiments

We use a simple convolutional neural network and settings coming from [the experiments](https://github.com/MedMNIST/experiments) repository.
<br/>

## II. How to run this tutorial (without TLC and locally as a simulation):
### 0. If you haven't done so already, create a virtual environment, install OpenFL, and upgrade pip:
  - For help with this step, visit the "Install the Package" section of the [OpenFL installation instructions](https://openfl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#install-the-package).
<br/>

### 1. Split terminal into 3 (1 terminal for the director, 1 for the envoy, and 1 for the experiment)
<br/>

### 2. Do the following in each terminal:
   - Activate the virtual environment from step 0:

   ```sh
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   - If you are in a network environment with a proxy, ensure proxy environment variables are set in each of your terminals.
   - Navigate to the tutorial:

   ```sh
   cd openfl/openfl-tutorials/interactive_api/PyTorch_FedProx_MedMNIST
   ```
<br/>

### 3. In the first terminal, run the director:

```sh
cd director
./start_director.sh
```
<br/>

### 4. In the second terminal, install requirements and run the envoy:

```sh
cd envoy
pip install -r requirements.txt
./start_envoy.sh env_one envoy_config.yaml
```

Optional: Run a second envoy in an additional terminal:
  - Ensure step 2 is complete for this terminal as well.
  - Run the second envoy:
```sh
cd envoy
./start_envoy.sh env_two envoy_config.yaml
```
<br/>

### 5. In the third terminal (or forth terminal, if you chose to do two envoys) run the Jupyter Notebook:

```sh
cd workspace
jupyter lab Pytorch_FedProx_MedMNIST_2D.ipynb
```
- A Jupyter Server URL will appear in your terminal. In your browser, proceed to that link. Once the webpage loads, click on the Pytorch_FedProx_MedMNIST_2D.ipynb file.
- To run the experiment, select the icon that looks like two triangles to "Restart Kernel and Run All Cells".
- You will notice activity in your terminals as the experiments runs, and when the experiment is finished the director terminal will display a message that the experiment was finished successfully.

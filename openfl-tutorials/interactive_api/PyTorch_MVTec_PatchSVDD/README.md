### 1. About dataset

MVTec AD is a dataset for benchmarking anomaly detection methods with a focus on industrial
inspection. It contains over 5000 high-resolution images divided into fifteen different object and
texture categories. Each class contains 60 to 390 normal train images (defect free) and 40 to 167
test images (with various kinds of defects as well as images without defects). More info
at [MVTec dataset](https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad). For each object, the
data is divided into 3 folders - 'train' (containing defect free training images), 'test'(
containing test images, both good and bad), 'ground_truth' (containing the masks of defected
images).

### 2. About model

Two neural networks are used: an encoder and a classifier. The encoder is composed of convolutional
layers only. The classifier is a two layered MLP model having 128 hidden units per layer, and the
input to the classifier is a subtraction of the features of the two patches. The activation
function for both networks is a LeakyReLU with a Î± = 0.1. The encoder has a hierarchical structure.
The receptive field of the encoder is K = 64, and that of the embedded smaller encoder is K = 32.
Patch SVDD divides the images into patches with a size K and a stride S. The values for the strides
are S = 16 and S = 4 for the encoders with K = 64 and K = 32, respectively.

### 4. How to run this tutorial (without TLS and locally as a simulation):

Go to example folder:
cd <openfl_folder>/openfl-tutorials/interactive_api/PyTorch_MVTec_PatchSVDD

1. Run director:

```sh
cd director
bash start_director.sh
```

2. Run envoy:

```sh
cd envoy
bash start_envoy.sh env_one envoy_config.yaml
```

Optional: start second envoy:

- Copy `envoy` to another place and run from there:

```sh
bash start_envoy.sh env_two envoy_config_two.yaml
```

3. Run `PatchSVDD_with_Director.ipynb` jupyter notebook:

```sh
cd workspace
jupyter lab PatchSVDD_with_Director.ipynb
```

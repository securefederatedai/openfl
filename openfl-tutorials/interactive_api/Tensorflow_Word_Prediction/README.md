# Next Word Prediction Tutorial on Keras

### 1. Data
Different envoys could have different texts, there were used 3 books of fairy tales:
- Polish Fairy Tales by A. J. GlinÃÅski https://www.gutenberg.org/files/36668/36668-h/36668-h.htm
- English Fairy Tales by Joseph Jacobs https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/7439/pg7439-images.html
- American Fairy Tales by L. FRANK BAUM https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4357/4357-h/4357-h.htm

### 2. Keras Model
At this point OpenFL maintains Sequential API and Functional API. Keras Submodel is not supported.

## To run experiment:
1. Create a folder for each envoy (they can be subfolders of `envoy_folder` for simulation purposes or folders on different machines in a real-life setting), in our case we should create three folders.
2. Put a relevant `shard_config` in each of the three folders and copy other files from `envoy_folder` there as well.
3. Modify the `start_envoy` accordingly:
   1. change `env_one` to `env_two`, `env_three` (or any unique envoy names you like)
   2. `shard_config_one.yaml` to  `shard_config_two.yaml` and `shard_config_three.yaml`.
4. Install requirements for each envoy: `pip install -r sd_requirements.txt`
5. Run the director: execute `start_director.sh` in `director_folder`.
6. Run the envoys: execute `start_envoy.sh` in each envoy folder.
7. Run the notebook in `workspace`.

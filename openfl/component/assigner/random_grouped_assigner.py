    start is with a:

            Given a set of task groups, and a percentage,
            assign that task group to that percentage of collaborators in the
            federation.
            After assigning the tasks to collaborator, those tasks should be
            carried out each round (no reassignment between rounds).
        - GroupedAssigner :
            Given task groups and a list of collaborators that belong to that
            task group, carry out tasks for each round of experiment.

    Attributes:
        task_groups* (list of object): Task groups to assign.
